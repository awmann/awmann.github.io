  </video> <br>When a planet such as K2-33b passes in front of its host star, it blocks some of the star&#39;s light. Observing this periodic dimming, called a transit,
  from continual monitoring of a star&#39;s brightness, allows astronomers to detect planets outside our solar system with a high degree of certainty.
  This Neptune-sized planet orbits a star that is approximately 11 million years old. In addition to the planet, the star hosts a disk of planetary debris,
  seen as a bright ring encircling the star. Animation credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech </center>

  The planet has a five-day orbit, whereas Mercury orbits our sun in 88 days. The planet is also nearly 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the sun.

The two bright stars are Nu Scorpii (left) and Beta Scorpii (right), both likely members of Upper Scorpius. The cloudy region around Nu Scorpii is a reflection nebula; residual dust from recent star formation as well as interstellar dust is reflecting light from the bright star. A zoom-in inset is shown around the star K2-33b, with the planet host circled in red.

<a href="https://mcdonaldobservatory.org/news/releases/20160224">UT press release</a> has some basic information about the system. The discovery was also featured in <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/exoplanet-in-hyades-star-cluster-0703201623/">Sky and Telescope<a> (among other places).
