<center><b><font size="5"><a name="metal">Searching for Planets through Astrophysical Noise</a></b></font></center>
<br>
		<div class="col5">
<br> <p>A major problem limiting our search for young planets, as well
 as general searches for transiting and radial velocity planets is
 strongly correlated astrophysical noise. This noise cannot be
 mitigated wth better precision data, and in most cases cannot
 directly modeled due to a poor understanding of the underlying
 astrophysics. Examples include stellar rotation and spots, flaring,
 and magnetic activity cycles.</p>

	  <p>We employ a range of techniques to mitigate or remove
	  astrophysical noise. Our primary method is the `notch'
	  filter, which takes king advantage of the fact
	  that we know something about the transit shape (a 'U' or
	  trapezoidal shape), although our methods can be generalized
	  to any shape for which we have a model. This uses a transit
	  model to build a small notch in the variability
	  fit. Assuming a transit is present lets us use an extremely
	  aggressive stellar variability fit algorithm without
	  removing a real transit, or allowing transits to bias our
	  stellar variability fit.</p>

	  <p>In cases where the stellar signal is too strong or the
		  planetary signal is too weak for individual notch
		  triggers we can use a star-driven method (we call LOCOR). Here we fit
		  stellar variability with linear combinations of
		  other regions of the light curve. Essentially we are
		  using the light curve to fit out itself. The danger
		  is that, if the stellar and orbital signals work on
		  similar timescales, the transit can be removed or
		  the signal weakened. However, we can correct for
		  this in our occurrence rate estimates noting that
		  such instances should be extremely rare.

		(Zodiacal Exoplanets in Time) Survey</a></b></font></center>
<br>
		<div class="col5">
<br> <p>Planets and their host stars evolve with time, and the first few
	  hundred million years are thought to be the most
	  formative. Assembly of the core of giant planets likely
	  occurs in the first 10 million years, and final formation of rocky
	  terrestrial planets in the first 10-100 million
	  years. Planets may evolve for several hundred million years
	  after this due to accretion of residual planetesimals, loss
	  of their atmosphere from X-ray and UV emission from the
	  star, and gravtiation interactions with other planets or
	  companion stars (if present). </p>

	  <p>Most planets discovered to date are much older than the
	  timescales of interest. Kepler target stars, for example,
	  are overwhelmingly more than a billion years old. Further, young stars are noisier, making it
	  difficult to detect young planets through the transit or
	  radial velocity methods. Direct imaging can detect young
	  planets, but is generally only sensitive to > Jovian-mass
	  objects far from their host star. So we remain relatively
	  ignorant about the critical period of planetary evolution. </p>

	  <p>The Zodial Exoplanets in Time (ZEIT) survey focuses on
	  filling this gap by
	  identifying transiting planets in K2 (repurposed Kepler)
	  observations of young clusters and
	  OB associations. The photometric precision and continuous observing
	  from K2 enables us to fit out much of the stellar
	  variability, revealing planets as small as 1.5 Earth radii. So far we have already identified systems in
	  Upper Scorpius (~11 million years old), Hyades (800 million
	  years old), and Praesepe (800 million years old). These discoveries have already
	  provided important clues about how close-in planets migrate.

		<div class="col5">
 <p>Cool, late-type dwarf stars (M dwarfs) are attractive targets for planet searches because their small size
		  and low mass facilitates the discovery of smaller
		  and less massive planets. They are also by far the common star in the Solar Neighborhood
		  (about 70% are M dwarfs). A disproportionate number
		  of Habitable-zone and Earth-like planets are around
		  M dwarfs.</p>

		 <p> Despite their importance in both Galactic and
		 exoplanet studies, their parameters are poorly
		 understood compared to their Sun-like
		 counterparts. Their cool atmospheres enable the
		 formation of complex molecules that are hard to model
		 and make traditional
		 methods to estimate stellar parameters difficult.</p>

		  <p>We focus on estimating M dwarf parameters using
		  'touchstone' stars, for which we can estimate their
		  parameters empirically. From here we can calibrate
		  varying techniques until they match the empirically
		  derived valies. Then we apply these calibrated
		  techniques to much larger samples of stars for which
		  direct measurements are impossible. </p>
