  (Zodiacal Exoplanets in Time) Survey</a></b></font></center>
  <br>
<div class="col5">
  <br> <p>Planets and their host stars evolve with time, and the first few
  hundred million years are thought to be the most
  formative. Assembly of the core of giant planets likely
  occurs in the first 10 million years, and final formation of rocky
  terrestrial planets in the first 10-100 million
  years. Planets may evolve for several hundred million years
  after this due to accretion of residual planetesimals, loss
  of their atmosphere from X-ray and UV emission from the
  star, and gravtiation interactions with other planets or
  companion stars (if present). </p>

  <p>Most planets discovered to date are much older than the
  timescales of interest. Kepler target stars, for example,
  are overwhelmingly more than a billion years old. Further, young stars are noisier, making it
  difficult to detect young planets through the transit or
  radial velocity methods. Direct imaging can detect young
  planets, but is generally only sensitive to > Jovian-mass
  objects far from their host star. So we remain relatively
  ignorant about the critical period of planetary evolution (right). </p>

  <p>The Zodial Exoplanets in Time (ZEIT) survey focuses on
  filling this gap by
  identifying transiting planets in K2 (repurposed Kepler)
  observations of young clusters and
  OB associations. The photometric precision and continuous observing
  from K2 enables us to fit out much of the stellar
  variability, revealing planets as small as 1.5 Earth radii. So far we have already identified systems in
  Upper Scorpius (~11 million years old), Hyades (650 million
  years old), and Praesepe (650 million years old). These discoveries have already
  revealed that young planets are larger than their older
  counterparts (right) and helped place constraints on the
  exoplanet migration timescale.

<center><b><font size="5"><a name="metal">Searching for Planets through Astrophysical Noise</a></b></font></center>
<br>
<div class="col5">
  <br> <p>A major problem limiting our search for young planets, as well
  as general searches for transiting and radial velocity planets is
  strongly correlated astrophysical noise. This noise cannot be
  mitigated wth better precision data, and in most cases cannot
  directly modeled due to a poor understanding of the underlying
  astrophysics. Examples include stellar rotation and spots, flaring,
  and magnetic activity cycles.</p>

  <p>We employ a range of techniques to mitigate or remove
  astrophysical noise. Our primary method is the `notch'
  filter, which takes king advantage of the fact
  that we know something about the transit shape (a 'U' or
  trapezoidal shape), although our methods can be generalized
  to any shape for which we have a model. This uses a transit
  model to build a small notch in the variability
  fit. Assuming a transit is present lets us use an extremely
  aggressive stellar variability fit algorithm without
  removing a real transit, or allowing transits to bias our
  stellar variability fit.</p>

  <p>In cases where the stellar signal is too strong or the
  planetary signal is too weak for individual notch
  triggers we can use a star-driven method (we call LOCOR). Here we fit
  stellar variability with linear combinations of
  other regions of the light curve. Essentially we are
  using the light curve to fit out itself. The danger
  is that, if the stellar and orbital signals work on
  similar timescales, the transit can be removed or
  the signal weakened. However, we can correct for
  this in our occurrence rate estimates noting that
  such instances should be extremely rare.

  <br> Orbit of the M dwarf GJ 1005AB. With an orbit
  like this, we determine the mass of the system and
  explore fundamental relations between M dwarf masses
  and other properties (temperature, luminosity,
  activity, and metallicity).
</div></center>
<div class="col5">
  <p>Cool, late-type dwarf stars (M dwarfs) are attractive targets for planet searches because their small size
  and low mass facilitates the discovery of smaller
  and less massive planets. They are also by far the common star in the Solar Neighborhood
  (about 70% are M dwarfs). A disproportionate number
  of Habitable-zone and Earth-like planets are around
  M dwarfs.</p>

  <p> Despite their importance in both Galactic and
  exoplanet studies, their parameters are poorly
  understood compared to their Sun-like
  counterparts. Their cool atmospheres enable the
  formation of complex molecules that are hard to model
  and make traditional
  methods to estimate stellar parameters difficult.</p>

  <p>We focus on estimating M dwarf parameters using
  'touchstone' stars, for which we can estimate their
  parameters empirically. This includes stars with
  radii from <a
  href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/public/basics-of-interferometry">long-baseline
  interferometry</a>, masses from dynamical orbits or
  binaries, and luminosities from a parallax and the
  broad-band spectral-energy-distribution (SED).<P>

  With large samples of touchstone stars, we can then
  explore the relations for M dwarfs, including the
  fundamental mass-luminosity relation. This also lets
  us calibrate empirical relations between easily
  measured parameters (like absolute magnitude) and
  fundamental properties (like effective temperature
  and radius). Such relations can then be used to
  assign parameters to much larger samples of stars
  where direct measurements of their radii and masses
  are not possible. </p>
