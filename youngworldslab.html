  <br> <p>Mackenna is a fifth-year graduate student in the in
  the Department of Physics and Astronomy. She works on measuring ages
  of known and newly identified young stellar
  associations near the Sun using a variety of
  methods, including lithium abundances (the lithium
  depletion boundary). This includes work identifying
  low-mass members of existing young stellar
  associations. <br><br>

  Mackenna also works on placing robust
  limits on unseen stellar companions to planet hosts
  from the K2 and TESS missions. Her framework has already been used
  to aid with exoplanet validation (e.g., <a
  href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AJ....160...33R/abstract">Rizzuto
  et al 2020</a> and

  She is a fourth-year graduate student in the in
  the Department. Her research focuses on
  characterizing atmospheres of young planets through
  their transit depth as a function of wavelength
  (transmission spectroscopy). The greater goal is to
  study how planetary atmospheres change with time by
  comparing the transmission spectra of young planets
  to their older counterparts.
  <br><br>
  The figure on the right shows transits of the 700
  million-year-old planet, K2-25b,
  taken with (top to bottom) K2, LCO, MEarth, and two
  Spitzer bands. The K2 transit appears 'smoother'
  because of the long integration time (30m) compared to
  the other datasets (3 minutes or lower). The
  difference in transit depth over these wavelengths
  tells us about the overall properties of the
  planet. More on these observations can be found in

  <br> <p >Reilly is a fourth-year graduate student in the in
  the Department of Physics and Astronomy. He is interested in young
  exoplanets and stellar systems. His current work
  focuses on the detection of the extended atmospheres
  (exospheres) of young planets using transmission
  spectroscopy in regions related to atmospheric
  escape (e.g., H&alpha; and He10830). The greater
  goal is to understand how planets lose their
  atmospheres as they evolve (e.g.,
  photoevaporation).

  determining the orbital eccentricities of young (<1000
  Myr) transiting planets using data primarily from the

  the eccentricities of young planets to their older
  counterparts, testing the hypothesis that planets are born in
  chaotic, highly eccentric orbits that dampen over time into more circular ones.
