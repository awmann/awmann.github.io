    <a href="https://www.zonta.org/Web/News_Events/Articles/Learn_more_about_the_exceptional_women_leading_the_way_in_aerospace.aspx">Zona Amelia Earhart</a>. 
  She is a sixth-year graduate student in the in
  the Department. Her research focuses on
  characterizing atmospheres of young planets through
  their transit depth as a function of wavelength
  (transmission spectroscopy). The greater goal is to
  study how planetary atmospheres change with time by
  comparing the transmission spectra of young planets
  to their older counterparts.
  <br><br>
  The figure on the right shows transits of the 700
  million-year-old planet, K2-25b,
  taken with (top to bottom) K2, LCO, MEarth, and two
  Spitzer bands. The K2 transit appears 'smoother'
  because of the long integration time (30m) compared to
  the other datasets (3 minutes or lower). The
  difference in transit depth over these wavelengths
  tells us about the overall properties of the
  planet. More on these observations can be found in

<div class="col5">
  <br> <p >Reilly is a sixth-year graduate student in the in
  the Department of Physics and Astronomy. He is interested in young
  exoplanets and stellar systems. His current work
  focuses on the detection of the extended atmospheres
  (exospheres) of young planets using transmission
  spectroscopy in regions related to atmospheric
  escape (e.g., H&alpha; and He10830). The greater
  goal is to understand how planets lose their
  atmospheres as they evolve (e.g.,
  photoevaporation).
  <br><br>

  When Reilly is not poring through data, he likes to play guitar, shoot photography, and play tabletop games with friends.

  <br> <p> Matt is a sixth-year graduate student in
  the Department of Physics and Astronomy. His research
  interests include both observational and computational
  astronomy, particularly on stars and planets. He is
  also interested in science policy, science education,
  and science communication. Currently, Matt works on
  deriving improved radii of young stars with
  protoplanetary disks using a combination of
  stellar models and semi-empirical relations. The goal
  is to understand how often planet-forming disks (and
  hence the young planets they form) are aligned with
  the rotational spin of their host stars.
