		  <p>I'm currently an assistant professor at the
		  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Up
		  until 2018, I was a Hubble Fellow at Columbia
		  University in the City of New York. </p>

		  <p>The primary research for my UNC-based team is to
		  understand how planets evolve over their
		  lifetimes. We focus on identifying and characterizing young
		  (100-1000 Myr) and infant (0-100 Myr) planets, which
		  offer a unique insight into the important
		  early physical processes that sculpt and shape older
		  planets, including those in the Solar System, and
		  can even tell us which early factors are important in the
		  formation of Earth-like and potentially habitable
		  planets. </p>

		  <p>Our group also works on
		  statistical properties of exoplanets (e.g., planet
		  occurrence, global population parameters, binarity),
		  primarily using data from the <a
		  href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html">Kepler</a>,
		  <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/">K2</a>,
		  and <a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS</a>
		  missions. Since we only understand exoplanets as well as well
		  as their host star, a lot of the statistical work focuses on
		  fundamental properties of late-type stars and their
		  younger counterparts. Because the datasets involved
		  tend to be large, many group members specialize in utilizing advanced computational and
		  statistical methods to analyze large data sets
		  (e.g., machine learning), and mitigating/modeling
		  the effects of astrophysical (correlated) noise.</p>

		  <p>Some more details on our recent work can be found on my <a
		  href="research.html">Research page</a>. </p>

		  <p>Recently, our team has become involved in designing and launching small satellites (Cubesats and
		  Smallsats) for doing high-impact astrophysics at
		  lower cost. </p>
						
		  <p>Those interested in working with me in any of
		  the science areas discussed above, or have a general
		  interest in stars and exoplanets are encouraged to
		  contact me at awmann [at] unc.edu to discuss
		  projects. </p>
