		  <p>I'm currently Hubble Fellow at Columbia
		  University in the City of New York. Before starting my Hubble in 2015, I was the Harlan J. Smith Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin.
		  
		  <p>My research focuses on understanding how
		  planets evolve over their lifetimes by identifying
		  planets around stars from 5 to 800 Myr, the
		  time periods where planets change the most. I am
		  similarly interested in studying statistical properties
		  of exoplanets, primarily with data from Kepler and K2 fields (e.g., planet occurrence, global population parameters, binarity),
		  as well as fundamental properties (radius, metallicity, mass, luminosity) of late-type (late K and M) and ultracool (M6 and 
		  later) dwarfs and their young (<1 Gyr old)
		  counterparts. More generally, I also study
		  computational methods to analyze astrophysical
		  problems with large data sets (e.g., machine learning), and handling
		  astrophysical and/or highly correlated noise (e.g.,
		  model-based filtering, Gaussian Processes).</p>
		  
		  <p> I'm PI of the ZEIT (Zodiacal Exoplanets in
		  Time) survey, which focuses on identifying and
		  characterizing planets in young clusters and star
		  forming regions (e.g., Upper Sco, Hyades, and
		  Pleiades) with data from the <a
		  href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/">K2</a>
		  mission. Check out some of the <a
		  href="media.html">media/press coverage</a> from this
		  survey. </p>
		 
			
		 <!-- <p>I completed my my PhD thesis in August 2013 at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii working with <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/FACULTY/GAIDOS/pebl.html">Eric Gaidos</a>. 
		  My thesis work centered on M dwarfs with transiting planets. This included developing techniques to find new transiting planets around M dwarfs,
		  methods to measure M dwarf metallicities, and studying systematics in transiting planet surveys.  </p>>
