  <p>I'm currently an associate professor at the
  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Up
  until 2018, I was a Hubble Fellow at Columbia
  University in the City of New York. </p>

  <p>The primary research for my UNC-based team is to
  understand how planets evolve over their
  lifetimes. We focus on identifying and characterizing young
  (100-1000 Myr) and infant (0-100 Myr) planets, which
  offer a unique insight into the important
  early physical processes that sculpt and shape older
  planets, including those in the Solar System, and
  can even tell us which early factors are important in the
  formation of Earth-like and potentially habitable
  planets. </p>

  <p>More generally, we work on the
  statistical properties of exoplanets (e.g., planet
  occurrence, global population parameters, binarity),
  primarily using data from the <a
  href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html">Kepler</a>,
  <a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/">K2</a>,
  and <a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS</a>
  missions. Since we only understand exoplanets as well
  as their host stars, a lot of the statistical work focuses on
  fundamental properties of late-type stars and their
  younger counterparts. Because the datasets involved
  tend to be large, many group members specialize in utilizing advanced computational and
  statistical methods to analyze large data sets
  (e.g., machine learning), and mitigating/modeling
  the effects of astrophysical (correlated) noise.</p>

  <p>Several team members focus on the properties of young and
  low-mass stars, partially driven by the need to better understand
  their planetary systems.

  <p>Recently, our team has become involved in designing and launching small satellites (Cubesats and
  Smallsats) both for education and for studying young stars and exoplanets. </p>

  <p>Some more details on our recent work can be found on my <a
  href="research.html">Research page</a>. </p>
<p>My cat, Bandit, is a regular attendee of both classes and group
meetings. He has particularly strong feelings about the Think-pair-share activities in Physics and Astronomy courses.
