		  <p>I'm currently an assistant professor at the
		  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My research focuses on understanding how
		  planets evolve over their lifetimes by comparing the
		  properties of young planets to their older
		  counterparts. I am PI of the ZEIT (Zodiacal
		  Exoplanets in Time) survey, which focuses on identifying and
		  characterizing planets in young clusters and star
		  forming regions (e.g., Upper Sco, Hyades, and
		  Pleiades) with data from the <a
		  href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/">K2</a>
		  mission. Check out some of the <a
		  href="media.html">media/press coverage</a> from this
		  survey. </p>

		  I also work more generally on
		  statistical properties of exoplanets (e.g., planet
		  occurrence, global population parameters, binarity),
		  primarily using data from the <a
		  href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html">Kepler</a>,
		  <a
		  href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/">K2</a>,
		  and <a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS</a> missions. 

		  Since we only understand exoplanets as well as well
		  as their host star, a lot of this work focuses on
		  fundamental properties of late-type stars and their
		  younter counterparts.</p>

		  I am also interested in computational methods to analyze astrophysical
		  problems with large data sets (e.g., machine learning), and handling
		  astrophysical and/or highly correlated noise (e.g., model-based filtering, Gaussian
		  Processes).</p>

		  More recently, I have become involved in using small sattelites (Cubesats and
		  Smallsats) for high-impact science at comparatively low cost. </p>
		  
		 
		 
			
		 <!-- <p>I completed my my PhD thesis in August 2013 at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii working with <a href="http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/FACULTY/GAIDOS/pebl.html">Eric Gaidos</a>. 
		  My thesis work centered on M dwarfs with transiting planets. This included developing techniques to find new transiting planets around M dwarfs,
		  methods to measure M dwarf metallicities, and studying systematics in transiting planet surveys.  </p>>
