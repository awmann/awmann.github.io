	Mid- and Late-M Dwarfs

Description of contents: This package file includes .fits files of the 44 mid-
	to late-M dwarf companions used in this paper. Spectra are in vacuum and
	the star's rest wavelength following the procedure in the paper. Users 
	are urged to use caution when interpreting spectra near telluric lines.
	Most spectra cover 0.8-2.4 microns, but in some spectra the z-band could
	not be extracted properly.

System requirements: Requires a fits file reader. Fits files were created using 
  the IDL Function MWRFITS.  

Additional comments: In the header of each .fits file you will find details on 
	observations and data reduction (using SpeXTool).                                      
   The three columns of the array are: 
	- COLUMN1 =         Wavelength [microns]                                          
	- COLUMN2 =         Flux  [erg s-1 cm-2 A-1]                                          
	- COLUMN3 =         Error [erg s-1 cm-2 A-1]
